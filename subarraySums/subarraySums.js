/*
Given an array A of integers, return the number of (contiguous, non-empty) subarrays that have a sum divisible by K.



Example 1:

Input: A = [4,5,0,-2,-3,1], K = 5
Output: 7
Explanation: There are 7 subarrays with a sum divisible by K = 5:
[4, 5, 0, -2, -3, 1], [5], [5, 0], [5, 0, -2, -3], [0], [0, -2, -3], [-2, -3]


Note:

1 <= A.length <= 30000
-10000 <= A[i] <= 10000
2 <= K <= 10000
*/

/**
 * @param {number[]} A
 * @param {number} K
 * @return {number}
 */

/*
  i: array A of integers
  o: number of contiguous, non-empty subarrays with sum divisible by K
  complexity: quadratic time, linear space (need to consider every subarray, but don't need to save them anywhere)
  constraint: 'divisible': remainder is 0 when dividing
  edge: K = 0. Return 0--fraction would be undefined

  ideas:
  * two pointers for start & end of subarray
  * helper function to determine sum of subarray
  * counter for # subarrays divisible

  pseudo~~
  create counter, set to 0
  iterate `start` from 0 to A.length - 2
    iterate `end` from start + 1 to A.length - 1
      determine sum of subarray
      if sum is divisible by K
        increment counter
  return counter

  * optimization for time complexity
    create storage object where storage[start][end] is the sum
    e.g.:
    storage = {
        0: {
            1: 1,
            2: 2,
            .
            .
            .
            400: 400
        }
    }
  each time you need a sum, first check whether storage[start][end - 1] exists
    if so, just add A[end - 1] to that
    if not, do the typical sum
  returning a sum: save it in storage

  deficiencies:
    slow time complexity--possibly store sums as you go
        also, don't copy array: make sum function that operates on input array
